# Welcome to My GitHub Profile Repository! 👋

Hey there! I'm excited to share my personal projects, thoughts, and contributions with you. This repository is where you'll find everything about my journey as a developer and content creator.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about coding, building communities, and sharing knowledge with others. My GitHub profile is where I keep track of my open-source projects, collaborations, and anything cool I’m working on. 

🔧 **Technologies I work with:**

- JavaScript
- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Smaller languages such as XML and JSON for game modding
- Git & GitHub
- Various APIs

I also work with various other applications throughout my day-to-day life:
- Notion for note taking, goal setting, and project documentation.
- Notion calendar to keep track of my tasks and ensure nothing goes unnoticed/unplanned.
- Canva for creating the content that is shared on my channels/social media.

💡 **Current Focus:**
Building tools to automate my life as much as possible. Most of these tools will be using Python and various APIs. I aim to automate most of my repetitive tasks to open up my schedule for more personal tasks.

## 📌 Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights from my work:

### [🤳 Large-Scale Discord Bot (Python)](https://github.com/GuyMcKechnie/Saddu)
My first ever project. It is a huge discord bot that boasts many, many features that took me around 6 months to complete. I created it for my Discord community of 200 members. 

### [💻 Community Hub Website (HTML/CSS/JS)](https://github.com/GuyMcKechnie/TheBibleApp.github.io)
A project that is used most often by the world. This is the hub for my community that includes various social media links to all the different platforms we are on. This community is a catalyst to many of the projects in my portfolio including a web scraper that automatically updates the contents of this project. You can find out more about that project [here](https://github.com/GuyMcKechnie/MemberCountScraper).

### [🏥 Full Hospital Application (Java)](https://github.com/GuyMcKechnie/TheBibleApp.github.io)
Used as my project for my final application for a school assignment. This is a fully fledged hospital management application built in Java. It has database management, visuals, and plenty of features.
